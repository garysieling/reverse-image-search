Data pipeline:

1. A set of images
2. Normalization
   a. Items per class
   b. Split into test/train/validation
   c. Resizing
   d. Color space
3. Feature engineering pre-processing
4. Train one or more ML model w/ different settings (Facenet)
5. Cluster the output at different levels
	 a. I.e 5,10,100 clusters
   b. Clusters of 3,3,3,3 etc
   c. Mark approx center image for each cluster
6. UI to visualize + name clusters
7. Zeppelin notebooks to poke at the behavior of each of the above steps
